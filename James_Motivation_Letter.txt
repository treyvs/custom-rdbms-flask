MOTIVATION LETTER

Dear DEAN Kenya Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Graduate Intern position for ICT & Educational Technology at DEAN Kenya. As a Bachelor of Science in Informatics and Computer Science student at Strathmore University, with hands-on experience in full-stack development and a demonstrated commitment to leveraging technology to enhance learning outcomes, I am convinced that I am the ideal candidate to contribute meaningfully to your mission of bridging the gap between traditional teaching and digital classrooms.

ALIGNMENT WITH YOUR REQUIREMENTS

My Computer Science degree directly satisfies your requirement for an ICT/Computer Science specialized graduate. More importantly, my professional journey demonstrates a deep commitment to educational transformation in Kenya. Through my role as an IT Intern at CITAM Schools, I gained practical exposure to how technology integrates into educational environments. I successfully managed school administration systems, provided technical support, and taught computer studies to Grade 7 and 8 students, giving me firsthand understanding of both the technical infrastructure and pedagogical challenges in Kenyan classrooms.

My technical specialization in full-stack development, combined with my experience building Campus Wire—an educational technology platform that centralizes campus information and enhances student engagement—demonstrates my capability to reorganize, annotate, and digitize educational content for the CBC framework. I have proven expertise in creating user-friendly interfaces that make complex information accessible to diverse audiences, a skill essential for content curation across CBC grades.

WHY DEAN KENYA NEEDS ME

I possess a genuine passion for using technology to transform how Kenyan teachers and learners engage with knowledge. My background in cybersecurity and ethical hacking, coupled with my understanding of information systems, positions me to handle content curation with technical rigor while ensuring accessibility and security. The multifaceted technical skills I have developed—from database design to responsive web development to system optimization—will enable me to contribute effectively across all aspects of your educational technology initiatives.

My experience collaborating with diverse teams on complex projects has refined my communication, collaboration, and leadership abilities. I have demonstrated these soft skills through my active involvement in Strathmore's Computing and Engineering Students Association, Debate Club, and Cybersecurity Club, where I engage in critical discussions and knowledge sharing. These experiences have equipped me to work seamlessly with your internal team and contribute meaningfully to DEAN Kenya's vision.

WHAT I WILL BRING

- Technical expertise in full-stack development, database management, and content management systems
- Practical understanding of educational contexts and student/teacher needs
- Proven ability to translate technical concepts into accessible solutions
- Strong research and analytical skills to identify best practices in educational technology
- Genuine commitment to digital literacy transformation in Kenyan schools
- Reliability, work ethic, and passion for driving meaningful impact

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to DEAN Kenya's transformative work. The internship aligns perfectly with my professional aspirations, and I am committed to making a measurable impact during these four months while building a long-term relationship with an organization whose vision inspires me.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my technical expertise, educational background, and passion for classroom transformation can advance DEAN Kenya's mission to unleash the potential of digital education in Kenya.

Yours sincerely,

James Trevor Tharao
